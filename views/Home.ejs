  <h1>Welcome to My Recipe World!</h1>
  <p>Hi! I'm Melody, and cooking has always been a huge part of my life. Whether it's comfort food or something adventurous, I find joy in exploring new flavors and sharing them with others.</p>

  <h2>My Favorite Dish</h2>
  <p>One of my all-time favorite dishes is <strong>Ackee and Saltfish</strong>. Reminds me of Canada, and was a comfort food for me when I was younger.</p>

  <img src="/images/ackee.jpg" alt="Ackee and Saltfish" style="width: 60%; max-width: 500px; border-radius: 8px; margin: 1rem 0;">

  <p>My goal with this site is to share some of my favorite recipes categorized by protein type. I hope you find inspiration, whether you're craving something hearty like meatballs or something light like tuna onigiri!</p>
